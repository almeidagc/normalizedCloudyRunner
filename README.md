Generates a grid of N photoionization models using the Cloudy code, version 17.03. The main objective is to vary specific parameters to analyze the geometry and chemical composition of the ionized gas clouds surrounding the supermassive black hole in an AGN.
The variation ranges were defined based on previous studies of these objects, but the code was designed to offer flexibility, allowing researchers to adjust the parameters according to the needs of their investigation. In the code, these variables represent the following parameters:
•	"aox" = The parameter “αox”  represents the spectral energy distribution (SED) and quantifies the ratio between the radiation flux in X-rays and ultraviolet. Higher values indicate a "harder" ionizing spectrum, with greater photon emission above 13.6 eV.
•	"u" = The ionization parameter is a dimensionless quantity that expresses the ratio between the number of ionizing photons emitted by a source and the hydrogen atom density in the gas. This parameter depends on the number of photons with energy above 13.6 eV emitted per second, the distance between the ionizing source and the illuminated face of the cloud, the total hydrogen density—considering its ionized, molecular, and neutral forms—and the speed of light. It can also be expressed in terms of the ionizing photon flux at the illuminated face of the cloud.
•	"d" = Hydrogen plays a crucial role in astrophysical plasmas due to its high abundance, accounting for approximately 80% of the atoms present in the gas. For this reason, its density is a fundamental parameter in photoionization simulations. In Cloudy, the hden command defines the total hydrogen density, considering the sum of its different forms, including atomic, ionic, and molecular, as well as possible additional contributions.
•	"z" = Metallicity refers to the presence of elements in the gas, excluding hydrogen and helium. Considering the solar oxygen abundance as 12+log(O/H)=8.6912, the metallicity variation range is set between 8.0 and 9.2 on this scale.
In the models, all metals were scaled linearly with metallicity, except for sulfur, nitrogen, and helium, for which specific relations were adopted. The sulfur scale was fixed at 1.20, while the nitrogen scale followed the equation proposed by Carvalho et al. (2020). The helium scale was based on the relation presented by Dors et al. (2022).
Thus, input files (with the ".in" extension) are created and executed with the Cloudy code, generating photoionization models (with the ".out" extension).
These parameters produced a grid of 21,000 photoionization models.
